# Agriculture-Data-Explorer
AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian agriculture 

🌾 Agriculture Production Analysis (India) — EDA Project
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on Indian agricultural data at the district and state level, uncovering patterns, trends, and insights across multiple crops over time.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes district-wise and year-wise agricultural data with the following key features:
Geographical Attributes:
state_name, dist_name, year, dist_code
Crop Metrics: Area (in hectares),Production (in tonnes),Yield (in kg/ha)
Crops Covered:
Cereals: Rice, Wheat, Maize, Sorghum (Kharif & Rabi), Pearl Millet, Finger Millet
Oilseeds: Groundnut, Sunflower, Soyabean, Total Oilseeds
Commercial Crops: Sugarcane, Cotton

🔍 Key Insights & Analysis Performed
📈 Year-wise Trends:
Analyzed production and yield trends across years for major crops
🌾 Crop Comparison:
Compared yield and area across crops to identify performance gaps
📍 State-Level Insights:
Identified top-performing states in crop production and yield
⚖️ Yield Efficiency:
Explored disparities in yield across crops and regions
📊 Infographic-Style Visuals:
Created artistic and clear visuals using pie charts, line graphs, and bar plots
📉 Correlation Checks:
Studied the relationship between area and yield for crop productivity

💡 Project Objectives
Understand agricultural patterns and crop trends at the district/state level
Identify high-yield and high-production regions for each crop
Build engaging and insightful visualizations using Python and Power BI

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Colab) – Data analysis and visualization
(Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Power BI and Streamlit – Interactive dashboard for crop comparison
